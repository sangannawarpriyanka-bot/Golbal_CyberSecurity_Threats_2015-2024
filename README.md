📌 Project Overview:
--

This project analyzes global cybersecurity threats between 2015–2024 using Excel. The dataset includes details about attack types,
target industries, financial losses, affected users, attack sources, vulnerabilities, defense mechanisms, and resolution times.

The goal of this project is to:

- Understand global trends in cyberattacks

- Identify the most damaging attack types and industries

- Evaluate the effectiveness of defense mechanisms

- Visualize cybersecurity insights using Pivot Tables, Charts, and Dashboards.

📊 Dataset Description:
--

The dataset contains 10 fields with records of cyberattacks from multiple countries.

| Column Name                | Description |
|-----------------------------|-------------|
| **Country**                 | Country where the attack occurred |
| **Year**                    | Year of the incident (2015–2024) |
| **Attack_Type**             | Type of cyberattack (Phishing, Ransomware, DDoS, etc.) |
| **Target_Industry**         | Industry targeted (Banking, IT, Healthcare, etc.) |
| **Financial_Loss_Million_USD** | Estimated financial loss (in millions of USD) |
| **Users_Affected**          | Number of affected users |
| **Attack_Source**           | Source of attack (Hacker Group, Nation-state, Insider, etc.) |
| **Security_Vulnerability_Type** | Exploited vulnerability (Weak Passwords, Unpatched Software, etc.) |
| **Defense_Mechanism_Used**  | Defense strategy used (Firewall, VPN, AI-based Detection, etc.) |
| **Incident_Resolution_Hours** | Time taken to resolve the attack (in hours) |

🚀 How to Use:
--

- Download the dataset from dataset/cybersecurity_threats.xlsx

- Open the dashboard file from dashboard/cybersecurity_dashboard.xlsx

- Use filters (Year, Country, Attack Type) to explore insights

---

📢 Insights (Sample Highlights):
--

- Ransomware & DDoS cause the highest financial losses

- Healthcare & IT industries are most frequently targeted

- Insider attacks take longer to resolve compared to other sources

- AI-based Detection has lower average resolution times than traditional defenses.
